## PHIL 152 - Introduction to Ethics

An introduction to fundamental issues in ethics, looking at classic and more recent responses to questions such as: Are there objectively right or wrong actions and better or worse ways of living? What makes them right/wrong or better/worse? How, more generally, can we justify ethical beliefs? Various responses to these questions, emphasizing personal motivations, personal character, consequences of actions, social contracts, or inviolable rules, will be explored. Criticisms and skeptical responses to traditional moral theory will also be considered.
