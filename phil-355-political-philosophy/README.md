## PHIL 355 - Political Philosophy

A critical examination of selected philosophical theories aimed at addressing such questions as: What is the extent of political authority, and what (if any) legitimate forms can it take? Can coercion by the state be justified? What are the obligations of citizens? What is the nature of law, and can the rule of law extend to states? What understanding of human nature and human needs underlies the various particular answers to such questions? Readings may be drawn from historical as well as contemporary sources.

Additionally, this course serves as a "seminar" for a Supreme Court case reading group.
