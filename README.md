## bookish-doodle

This repository is where I track my progress through a self-guided undergraduate philosophy curriculum. The name `bookish-doodle` is a bit of serendipity; GitHub randomly generated the suggestion when I created the repository, and I thought it fit the vibe.

I've stolen the course map from [the UMBC Philosophy Department](https://philosophy.umbc.edu), [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/), associated course catalogs, and syllabi I scrounge up from wherever.

### Conventions

To help structure the content in here, I'm trying to stick to the following high-level conventions:

- Projects for each course (with standard "To do", "Doing", "Done" swim lanes).
- Directories with their own READMEs for course content (when necessary).
- Issues for course requirements (e.g., reading assignments).
- When the principal topic is reading material, we'll use an inline citation format for Issue titles, with a full citation in the Issue body.
- Issue threads for open discussion and brainstorming.
