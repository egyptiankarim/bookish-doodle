## bookish-doodle

This repository is where I track my progress through a self-guided undergraduate philosophy curriculum. I've stolen the course map from [the UMBC Philosophy Department](https://philosophy.umbc.edu), associated course catalog, and syllabi I scrounge up from wherever.

### Conventions

To help structure the content in here, I'm trying to stick to the following high-level conventions:

- Projects for each course (with standard "To do", "Doing", "Done" swim lanes).
- Directories with their own READMEs for course content.
- Issues for course requirements (e.g., reading assignments).
- Issue threads for open discussion and brainstorming.
- Issue templates for capturing citations.
